# 🚀 Quick Start

✅ Clone or fork `vestingVault`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/menezesphill/eggnator.git
```

💿 Install dependencies with yarn:

```sh
cd eggnator
yarn install
```

💿 Install truffle for all users:

```sh
npm install -g truffle
``` 

# 🧆 Navigating Truffle

✅ In case of making any modifications within .sol files, you can run:

```sh
truffle compile
```

To update build artifacts;

✅ Check if the test checklist passes by running:

```sh
truffle test
```

Testing cases are not as extensive as we would like. if you want to contribute creating new test cases, please do so.

✅ Deploying contracts to local testnet:

There is a portion of the community that might be tempted to use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) but we are not taking shortcuts. We would like to use a more "Orthodox" approach, if you will. For simplicity we will use Ganache GUI, which can be downloaded here: https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/

Upon starting Ganache, go ahead and `QUICKSTART` a new network, you will see a window that looks like this:

![](https://github.com/menezesphill/vestingVault/blob/master/img/ganache.png)

Make sure to change `NETWORK ID` and `RPC SERVER` info in your `truffle-config.js` file:

```jsx
  networks: {
     development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost
      port: 7545,            // Standard Ethereum port
      network_id: "5777",       // Any network
     },
   }
```

⚠️ ATENTION: If you are using a `WSL instance`, you might need to configure the correct network on Ganache in order to deploy to the testnet.

When you are good to go, you can go ahead and:

```sh
truffle migrate
```

Now you can also run the tests on your local testnet:

```sh
truffle test --network development
```

And interact with your Smart Contracts from the console:

```sh
truffle console
```
